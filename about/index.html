<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p> <img src="img/andrewg.jpg" alt="andrewg" Thank you for taking the time to view my site. I have been a fanatical collector of Western European Arms and Armor from the 15th – 17th century for many years. I often travel to small villages and out of the way cities in Europe in search of pieces that most collectors can only dream of. Since I can’t keep them all (or I upgrade a piece in my collection) over the years I have amassed a lengthy list of museums and collectors of impeccable taste that I sell to almost exclusively. Many of these top collectors also rely on me to sell their “trade ins“. Since I am a collector and I do not consider myself  a professional dealer my prices are usually the lowest world wide.

    If you are a beginner or advanced collector you have come to the right place. <br>
    
     
    <br>
    Here are a few important things you should keep in mind:<br>
    <br>
    – Arms and Armor is the most undervalued art in the world. You do not need to be rich in order to have a good collection. Knowledge in many cases is more important than money.<br>
    <br>
    – Up to 90% of the pieces you see advertised on Ebay and even in the major auction houses in Europe are fakes, reproductions, mis-cataloged or composite (put together from different non-original pieces or parts)!!! Many of these “non-period pieces” were made over 100 years ago during the Victorian/Historimus era (turn of the century Arms and Armour revival). They have age and old-school workmanship and I’ll tell you right now most collectors cannot tell them apart from real originals!<br>
    <br>
    – Most good pieces never make it to the auction houses! The top collectors sell, trade and buy among themselves. The pieces they can’t sell to other knowledgeable collectors are “unloaded” at the auction houses.<br>
    <br>
    – Most auction houses will charge you, the buyer, a 20% to 29% buyer’s premium plus vat taxes and a ridiculous amount for shipping and handling. The seller has to pay anywhere from 10% to 20% seller’s premium. Auction houses routinely make 30% to 45% of the value of an item and guess who is really paying that ridiculous amount. If you buy from an auction house generally you have to hold an item 4 to 8 years before you can sell the item for the amount you paid!<br>
    <br>
    – If you want to be a successful collector you need to learn to be patient. It’s not what you want that’s important, it’s what’s available and in your price range.<br>
    <br>
    – You are better off buying one good piece than 3 average pieces. The good ones always go up in value first.<br>
    <br>
    – I am always adding and upgrading my website. I never know what is going to be offered to me. So please come back and look often.<br>
    <br>
    – After a while I’ll understand what you like and will give you the opportunity to consider a piece before offering it on my website.<br>
    <br>
    – Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
    <br>
    <br>
    Good luck in your search.<br>
    Only the best,<br>
    Andrew Garcia</p>
